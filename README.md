# CostCribAnalyzer
Project built purely using DSA  concepts  

CostCribFinder is a powerful tool designed to identify the minimum housing cost based on surrounding conditions like amenities, crime rates, and environmental factors. Utilizing advanced data structures and algorithms (DSA), it provides efficient solutions for housing optimization.

Features
🏡 Optimized Housing Search: Finds the best housing options based on user-defined parameters.
📊 Cost Analysis: Calculates minimum housing costs using graph-based algorithms.
📍 Surrounding Condition Assessment: Considers factors like proximity to schools, markets, and safety zones.
🚀 Efficient Algorithms: Implements Dijkstra's, A*, and other graph traversal methods for fast computation.
